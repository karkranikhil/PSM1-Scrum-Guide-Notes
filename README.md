# PSM1-Scrum-Guide-Notes

## Scrum 
* Scrum is not a methodology or body of knowledge, is a framework. 
* A lot of organizations start implementing Agile in a cultural context that is mostly non-Agile.This creates tensions and frictions that the teams adopting Agile have to deal with.
* According to the Scrum Guide, a Sprint is a time-box of 4 weeks maximum (can be less).

## Scrum values. 
* Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness, Respect.

## Daily Scrum
* The only ones who must attend are the members of the Scrum Team. 
* The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting but he doesn’t need to be present at the meeting.
* Anyone else can attend but don’t “must” be there, and notice that the guests only watch and listen they don’t participate.

## Scrum Master responsibilities?
* The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption, planning Scrum implementations within the organization
* Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including, removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress.

## The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways like:
• Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality.
• Helping the Development Team to create high-value products.
• Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress.
• Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
• Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

## What is an output of a Sprint?
* A potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product.

## Duration of a Sprint
* No more than one month.
* Sufficiently short to maintain acceptable business risks for the product owner.
* Short enough to be able to synchronize the development work with other business processes.

# The Sprint over when?
* Scrum timeboxed events are not extendable, you can take the available time for some these events as maximum duration, so they can be finished earlier if everything is done, but Sprint timeboxes have a fixed duration, this means they can not shrink. If everything is finished before the end of the Sprint, the Development Team will pick the next item from the Product Backlog and starts working on that.

## Scrum Theory Pillars
Adaptation, Transparency, and Inspection are the Scrum Theory Pillars. Scrum as Agile framework, is mainly about adaptation (instead of prediction).

## proper way to ordering Product Backlog items
* The Product Backlog items are ordered accordingly based on their business value. 
* The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.
* The Product Owner can consider items size and risk, but among others, these are only criteria to establish final value. 
* Items should be independent of each other, in order to facilitate their ordering.

## Definition of “Done”?
The Definition of “Done” defines what is expected as result of the current Sprint.
* The purpose is to share the same understanding of the completed work to increase transparency.
* The Development Team must have present that the Definition of “Done” to create tasks, but also the description of each pulled Product Backlog items.
* Is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.
* Helps to create a shared understanding of what is the Backlog items scope in order to know when this is completed

## Three reasons why to include tests in the Definition of “Done” is a good practice?
* Because adds transparency to final increments.
* Because can simplyfy requierements definitions.
* Because the results are likely to be releasable.


## What two approaches should the Scrum Master take when your team doesn’t have the proper infrastructure to do the work needed to complete the selected Product Backlog items?
* Help the Scrum Team to create proper Sprint Goal and Definition of Done accordingly under current circumstances.
* Coach the Development Team to improve infrastructure while adjusting the Definition of Done properly.
note ** The infrastructure and tools are prepared gradually throughout the project, and the Sprint Goal and Definition of Done should be realistic and created accordingly.

# When the Development Team find itself in a situation where doesn’t have the proper tools and infrastructure, what are the best two things to do?
* Coach the Development Team to improve its skills, tools, and infrastructure over time and adjust the Definition of Done accordingly.
* The team must create a realistic Definition of Done under current circumstances.

## Which are three responsibilities of a self-organizing team?
* Estimate the amount of work needed to complete Product Backlog items.
* Set the necessary tasks for the Sprint Backlog elements.
* Pull the Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.

## Scrum promotes self-organized teams because 
* improve their self-accountability.
* improve their commitment.

## Development team responsibilities
* Measuring the performance of the Sprint.
* Estimate the work needed for Sprint Backlog items.
* Deal with internal team conflicts.

## good approaches for the Development Team to make non-functional requirements visible?
* Add them to the acceptance criteria as part of the definition of "Done".
* Add them to the Product Backlog and keep the Product Owner informed of the estimated effort.

## Who estimates the work during the Sprint?
* The Development Team.

## Who must do the work required for Product Backlog items, in order to create a potentially releasable Increment?
* The Development Team.

## Whose decision is it to establish the tasks to be performed during the Sprint?
* The Development Team.

## The Product Owner wants to create estimations and ask the Scrum Master for guidance about it. What is the most proper guideline that the Scrum Master should give?
* Development Team must create estimations.

## During the Sprint the Development Team determines that cannot complete its work by the end of the Sprint. What happens in this case?
* The current Sprint continues. The Product Owner and the Development Team will review and adjust the Sprint work selected, always following the Sprint Goal.

## How much time by day, should the Development Team work on their tasks?
* Enough to reach a constant pace and cadence.

## When Composition of the Development Team change?
*  Whenever really needed, while taking account a reduction in productivity in the short term.

## Who can decide add more work to the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint
* The Development Team.

## Best approach when a developer is not working properly?
* The Development Team is responsible about its members because it’s self-organized, this means its member decides about removing any member from the team. Since this situation is actually an impediment, the Scrum Master can help the team.

## Sprint zero.
* There’s no such thing as Sprint zero.
* The first Sprint is the first one, and it’s not different from other Sprints, from the perspective that the Developer Team should create an Increment. 
* The infrastructure, tools, and requirements are prepared gradually throughout the project.

## Project Manager 
* No Project Manager role in Scrum
* We have only just three roles in Scrum: Product Owner , Scrum Master , and Development Team . It’s not permitted to define new roles and the Development Team must be self-organizing and cross-functional.

## Hardening Sprint
* There’s no hardening Sprint, Sprint zero, integration Sprint, release Sprint, etc. There’s just one type of Sprint, and its goal is to create an Increment of potentially releasable valuable features.


## Product Owner responsibilities
* One the main responsibilities of the Product Owner is to maximize the value of the Development Team’s work, and he’s the only one who can add new items to the Product Backlog.
* Even when the Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog, the members don’t add items arbitrarily, the Product Owner must make sure that any new item adds value and she or he can work with proper stakeholders about it and then add it to the Product Backlog for the next Sprints.
* Also, the Product Owner can reject the new feature, rather than the Development Team.
* he is only responsible for communicating and engaging the stakeholders

## Sprint Planning
The Sprint Planning priority is answering two questions:
* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
* The team doesn’t need to get all the detail about every task as long these questions are answered and the pending definition can be completed as soon as possible in refinement activities.

## What is the max time-box duration for a Sprint Planning meeting?
* Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter

## Output of Sprint planning
* The Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog are created during the Sprint Planning meeting.

## Sprint Backlog
* Nobody can remove or change the Sprint Backlog items when the Sprint Planning is finished.
* The only exception is when there’s still time and the team has completed all items, in which scenario they will pull the next item from the top of the Product Backlog.

## The Sprint Backlog includes…
User Stories, Use Cases, Tests, Tasks and even other elements which help to define and clarify the work can be part of the Sprint Backlog.

## Cross-Functional team
* Cross-Functional means that the professionals in the Team Development should have the all the expertise to do the necessary work in order to deliver a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint.
* The Development Team is integrated not only by programmers, also can include desingers, testers, architects, etc.

## Note ** Developers should be self-organized and they’re responsible for teams formations and composition.

## Every increment should be released.?
* Every increment should be potentially releasable and completed based on the Definition of Done. However, increment doesn’t have to be actually released. The Product Owner decides if make sense to release or not.

## The structure of the Daily Scrum is set by the Development Team. - Yes
* The Development Team owns the Daily Scrum meetings, they can be conducted in different ways but always focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal.

## Always must be a Release after each Sprint. - No
* The main purpose of the Sprint is to create an increment of useable, and potentially releasable “Done” product.

## What is what usually happens when the Scrum Team becomes mature through the project?
* They are able to improve the Definition of Done.
* They are able to release every Increment.

## Sprint Retrospective meeting
* The Sprint Retrospective occurs always after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.

## Sprint Review 
* The Sprint Review is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. During this event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint, so is an opportunity for inspection and adaptation.

## What represents the trend line in a burndown chart?
* The remaining work to be completed if nothing changes on the Product Backlog or the Development Team.
* The trend line gives us visibility about the forecast for the finishing date, considering a constant development team Capacity for the Sprint Backlog.

## Product Owner says the customer has security concerns. Where can be addressed these concerns in Scrum?
* Can be handled in the Definition of Done.
* Can be added to the Product Backlog.
